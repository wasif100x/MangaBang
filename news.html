    <h1>One Piece New Flim : RED </h1>
    <img src="images/Mangabang.pic/one piece red.jpg" alt="Picture not avialable">
    <P>The trailer begins with Red Hair Shanks speaking to a young Uta while they look out into the distance. He says to
        her, “though we were apart, you will always be my daughter.” Clearly, the staff wanted to waste no time dropping
        such a huge bombshell of a revelation.

        A few clips pass by of other characters (some who might be a surprise like Koby and Bepo) before Luffy addresses
        Uta with a note of displeasure due to her current activities. No direct villain was hinted at, but it appears
        that Uta might not be the innocent fluff character type that typically characterizes some of the latest films in
        the franchise.

        Shanks goes on to mention that there iss no equality in this world. That is interesting dialogue from someone
        who has been revealed to be on good terms with the Gorosei-the leaders of the World Government that actively
        hunts pirates down.

        Uta is called “the world is greatest diva” and there are many tears shed throughout this brief, 45-second look
        at the film. It will be interesting to see what emotional beats this movie takes, especially with a character
        like Shanks who hasn not actually had much screen time throughout One Piece 1046 chapters.
